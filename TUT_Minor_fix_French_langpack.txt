Just one simple thing quickly noticed as of late while using the existing lang pack (Version v 1.8.28 (stable) 2021-10-28, 07:56 AM https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=download&pid=78&bid=4883 ) on 1830 while translating some plugins:

frontend side...

global.lang.php needs such added:

[code]
$l['expcol_collapse'] = '[-]';
$l['expcol_expand'] = '[+]';
[/code]

admin side...

admin/config_badwords.lang.php

[code]
$l['add_bad_word_desc'] = "Ici, vous pouvez ajouter un filtre de mots et son remplacement.";
[/code]

admin/config_banning.lang.php

[code]
$l['ban_an_ip_address'] = "Interdire une adresse IP";
[/code]

etc, etc... & most likely there may be more as one notices / finds such, but, just noting all found here initially at least of all the first few warnings about such in relation to subject matter and current usage on 1830. 

Best of luck.
